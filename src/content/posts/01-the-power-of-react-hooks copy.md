I’m currently an ACCA finalist and research analyst interested in financial advisory and portfolio management. As part of building my professional presence, I decided to create this portfolio site inspired by MarchesiQuant.

In this post, I share how I set up the site, customized it with my own details, and prepared it for future case studies and research projects. This is just the beginning — stay tuned for upcoming work in portfolio management, market research, and advisory.
